Question 1.

Load in the libraries you need, and look at the backpack data. Take note of variable names and dimensions.

#Load the libraries needed

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(CodeClanData)
library(tidyverse)
```

#Look data table
```{r}
backpack
```

#Variable names = backpack_weight, body_weight, ratio, back_problems, major, year, sex, status, units
Dimensions = 100 rows x 9 columns

Question 2.

What is the distribution of backpack weights that students are carrying? Choose an appropriate graph to show the distribution.

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = backpack_weight), fill = "light green")
```
#The above is a distribtion of count of number of students who have aweight of backpack (unspecified units)


Question 3.

Are there differences in backpack weight between sex?

weight of backpack by sex
```{r}
count_backpack <- backpack %>%
  group_by(backpack_weight, sex) %>%
  summarise(counts = n()) 
count_backpack
```

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = backpack_weight, fill = sex), position = "dodge") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("pink","light blue"))
```
#The above shows distribution of backpack weight vs count (number of students who have this backpack weight). This time sex is included in the graphs
There is not a huge difference in backpack weights, although bear in mind there are more female students in this data sample. The one outlier, where weight > 30, is from a male student.

Question 4.

What is the relationship between body weight and backpack weight?

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_line(aes(x = backpack_weight, y = body_weight), fill = "blue", 
  alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = backpack_weight, y = body_weight),
    alpha = 1
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    aes(x = backpack_weight, y = body_weight)
  )
```

#Here we see a plot of backpack weights vs body weight. There are some wild fluctuations, however the overall trend is increase in backpack weight correlates with an increase in body weight.

Question 5.

Is this relationship different between men and women? Choose an appropriate plot and interpret your findings.

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) +
  geom_line(aes(x = backpack_weight, y = body_weight, colour = sex), fill = "blue", 
  alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = backpack_weight, y = body_weight),
    alpha = 1
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    aes(x = backpack_weight, y = body_weight)
  )
```

#Plot of backpack weight vs body weight showing male and female data separately. There is still a trend of increasing backpack weight to body weight however there is much more fluctauation in the body weight of males.

Question 6.

What proportion of students report back pain?

```{r}
backpack %>%
  select(back_problems)%>%
  sum 
```
#Note I could have divided by number of rows but as it is trivially 100, the proportion is 32%


Question 7.

Is this proportion different between men and women?

```{r}
backpack %>%
  select(back_problems, sex)%>%
 filter(sex == "Male", back_problems == "1")
```

# 8 males have back problems
```{r}
backpack %>%
  select(sex) %>%
filter(sex == "Male") 
ncol()
```

The answer is yes. 8/45 males  so 24/55 females, approximately 44% females to 17% males reported back problems

Question 8.

Now youâ€™ve investigated your data separately, create plots to describe the relationship between backpack weight, body weight, gender and reported backpain.

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) + 
  aes(x = backpack_weight, y = body_weight, back_problems == 1, colour = sex) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ sex, ncol = 2) +
  labs(
    y = "Body weight",
    x = "Backpack weight",
    title = "Plots of weight vs backpack weight where backpain reported"
  )
```

#These are 2 plots side by side of backpack weight vs body weight separated by gender but with the same axes used.
Observations = In both genders, despite fluctuations, there is a noticaeble correlation where backpack weight increases with body weight.
There are a few spikes in the data where body weight is higher than usual for the backpack compared with the average. Perhaps this could suggest underlying back pain?

Out of interest, lets look at where backpain is not reported?

```{r}
ggplot(backpack) + 
  aes(x = backpack_weight, y = body_weight, back_problems == 0, colour = sex) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ sex, ncol = 2) +
labs(
    y = "Body weight",
    x = "Backpack weight",
    title = "Plots of weight vs backpack weight where no backpain reported"
  )
```

#We can see there is very little difference in the graphs, has backpain perhaps not been reported properly?
