#Load libraries first
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(CodeClanData)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

Task - 10 mins

Create a suitable plot for the following three datasets:

late_deliveries
recovery_times
fitness_levels

```{r}
(late_deliveries)
(recovery_times)
(fitness_levels)
```


```{r}
ggplot(late_deliveries) +
  geom_line(
  aes(x = day, y = value)) +
    labs(
    y = "late delivery value",
    title = "Plot of late deliveries vs date")
```

```{r}
# Dummy data
late_deliveries <- new_plot(
  day = as.Date("2015-01-01") - 0:364,
  value = runif(365) + seq(-140, 224)^2 / 10000
)

# Most basic bubble plot
p <- ggplot(data, aes(x=day, y=value)) +
  geom_line() + 
  xlab("")
p          #This was using a similar example online to see if it worked
```

```{r}
ggplot(recovery_times, aes(treatment_group, prognosis, colour = recovery)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = "light blue", high = "dark blue")
```

ggplot(fitness_levels) + 
  aes(x = child, y = fitness_score, color = group) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~age) + 
    scale_color_manual(values=c('#E69F00', '#56B4E9'))+
    labs(title = "Fitness levels of children")
    
```{r}
ggplot(fitness_levels) + 
  aes(x = group, y = fitness_score, color = child) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~age) + 
    scale_color_brewer()+
    labs(title = "Fitness levels of children")
```

3.2 Connection
Task - 10 mins

Choose a suitable plot for the following datasets:

blood_pressure
car_use

```{r}
(blood_pressure)
(car_use)
```

```{r}
ggplot(blood_pressure) +
  geom_point(
  aes(x = daily_saturated_fat_intake_mg, y = systolic_blood_pressure_mm_hg)) +
  labs(x = "fat intake mg",
       y = "systolic pressure mmhg",
   title = "Plot of fat intake vs systolic BP")
```


```{r}
ggplot(car_use) +
  geom_point(
  aes(x = city, y = air_so2_concentration_ppm, colour = population)) +
  labs(
   title = "Plot of car sO2 vs city")
```

3.3 Distribution

Plot the following two datasets.

d20_outcomes
d20x5_outcomes

```{r}
(d20_outcomes)
(d20x5_outcomes)
```

```{r}
ggplot(d20_outcomes) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = outcome), bins = 200) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
   title = "Plot of d20 outcomes vs count")
```

```{r}
ggplot(d20x5_outcomes) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = outcome), bins = 200) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
   title = "Plot of d20x5_outcomes vs count")
```

3.4 Composition

Make plots to display the data in:

pension_surplus
pension_liabilities

```{r}
(pension_surplus)
(pension_liabilities)
```

```{r}
ggplot(pension_surplus) + 
  aes(x = item, y = balance) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity") + 
  xlab("pension_surplus") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
   title = "Plot of pension surplus vs balance") 
```

Out of interest, what would a pie chart look like with negative figures?

```{r}
 ggplot(pension_surplus) + 
  aes(x =  item, y = balance) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity") + 
  xlab("pension_surplus") +
  coord_polar("y")
```

Try second graph

```{r}
ggplot(pension_liabilities) + 
  aes(x = year, y = liability_millions, colour = liability_type) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity") + 
  xlab("pension_liabilities") +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Liability in Â£m",
   title = "Plot of pension liabilities vs year")
```
