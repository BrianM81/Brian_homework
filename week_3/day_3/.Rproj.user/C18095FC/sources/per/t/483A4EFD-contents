Load the tidyverse library 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

# load the data in 
```{r}
twitter_data <- read_csv("code_clan_tweets.csv")
```

Question 1. Load the code_clan_tweets.csv data. Find the number of rows, columns, and list all the variable names.

```{r}
nrow(twitter_data) #Find number of rows
ncol(twitter_data) #Find number of columns
names(twitter_data) #Find names of the variables
```

Let's also get a glimpse of what it looks like
```{r}
head(twitter_data, 10)
```

Question 2. First, we’re going to summarise the number of likes (favorite_count) CodeClan tweets have. Create a boxplot to check for outliers.


```{r}
fave_tweets_pipe <- twitter_data %>% #let's have a look at the highest values
  group_by(favorite_count) %>%
    summarise(tweet_id = n()) %>%
    arrange(desc(favorite_count))

fave_tweets_pipe
```

Now lets look at the boxplot
```{r}
boxplot(twitter_data$favorite_count)
```
#A huge number of outliers are showing above, in particular the value at the top.

3. Find the total number of favourited tweets (stored in favorite_count) that CodeClan tweets have got. Don’t add a tweet’s favorite_count to the total when the tweet was quoted (see the is_quote variable).

```{r}
fave_count_pipe <- twitter_data %>%
select("favorite_count") %>%
sum() 
fave_count_pipe
```
#Above 446 is the count, however I need to find a way to remove favourite_counts when the tweet was quoted (quote_count != NA ?)

```{r}
fave_count_pipe <- twitter_data %>%
filter(is.na("data_count")) %>% 
  sum("favorite_count")
fave_count_pipe
```

#Not sure how to fix the above, maybe use mutate to remove data count values where !=NA?

4. Summarise the mean number of retweets (retweet_count), split by the type of platform that was used to tweet (source). Again, omit quoted tweets from the mean.

```{r}
sum_mean_retweets <- twitter_data %>%
  select(twitter_data, source, retweet_count, data_count) %>%
  group_by(source) %>%
  summarise(retweet_count = n()) %>%
  mutate(mean(retweet_count)) %>%
sum_mean_retweets
```

#I still need to find out how to omit tweets from the mean, quote_count is.na for example?
mutate(my_test = is.na(quote_count))

5.Count the total number of likes (i.e. total of favorite_count), split by media type, and arrange them from most likes to least. Assume that any tweets without a listed media type are of type “text”.

```{r}
new_count_pipe <- twitter_data %>%
select("favorite_count", "media_type") %>%
  group_by("media_type")
summarise(sum("favorite_count")) %>%
arrange(desc("favorite_count"))
new_count_pipe
```
#I'm not sure how to sum favourite count in the above example, and also how to input tweets without listed media type as text, tried example below

```{r}
new_count_pipe <- twitter_data %>%
select("favorite_count", "media_type") %>%
  mutate(media_type = replace_na(media_type, “text”))
  group_by("media_type")
summarise(sum("favorite_count")) %>%
arrange(desc("favorite_count"))
new_count_pipe
```


6. Find the mean number of characters that a CodeClan tweet contains.

```{r}
mean(twitter_data$display_text_width)
```

7. The code_clan_info.csv data file contains status_url along with other info. Load this in, and join it to the code_clan_tweets tibble, so that you have a status_url for each tweet. Decide which variable to join the tibbles on.



```{r}
more_data <- read_csv("code_clan_info.csv")
```
#Primary key = tweet ID

```{r}
inner_join(twitter_data, more_data, by ="tweet_ID")
```
#Need to join by primary key, but running out of time to fix this
